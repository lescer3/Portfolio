| [üó≥Ô∏è Voter Demographics](https://github.com/lescer3/Voter-Demographics/blob/main/Python/Final_Project%20(1).ipynb) | June 2025 | PySpark, pandas, sql, ml, matplotlib | My colleagues and I examined the national voter file for the US, focusing on the state of Washington. We were interested in uncovering what was causing disparity in voter participation, focusing on income and what characteristics had the largest effect on party vote percentage. |
| [üçøüé¨ Movie Recommender System](https://github.com/lescer3/Pstat134-Movie-Recommender-System/blob/main/results/Movie%20Recommender%20System%20Project.pdf) | March 2025 | numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn| My colleagues and I developed a movie recommendation system using data from The Movie Database (TMDb) database. We applied Python-based machine learning techniques to analyze user preferences and suggest relevant movies. |

| [üí° Electric Production Time Series](https://github.com/lescer3/Time-Series/tree/main/Electric_Production) | June 2025 | MASS, dplyr, tidyverse | I built a forecating model based on mothly electric production data. I then performed transformations and differencing to achieve stationarity and assessed multiple SARIMA models based on AICc, stationarity, and diagnostic checking. The chosen model's forecasts were within the 95% confidence intervals, indicating the model works well for forecasting electric production.|
| [üë∂üèº Fertility & Infant Mortality Rates](https://github.com/lescer3/PSTAT100-final/blob/main/final_project.pdf) | March 2025 | forcats, corrplot, ggplot2, tidyverse | I, alongside my colleague, explored how educational and regional factors influence birth rates (TFR) and infant mortality rates (TIMR) in the US. We were interested if current major conflicts will interrupt future population growth since TFR is at an all time low. Our results indicated education plays a significant role in TFR.
| [üöô MSRP Project](https://github.com/lescer3/MSRP-Project) | Dec 2024 | dplyr, naniar, tidyr, ggplot2 | I built a machine learning model to predict the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of cars based on various features. In addition, I was interested in knowing the most important car features that influence the price of a car and if there was any significant price differences between the type of transmission. To sastify my curiosity, I compared Stepwise Regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forest, and PCA by RMSE. Random Forest performed the best with the lowest RMSE. Additionally, the year the car was released, engine horsepower, and engine fuel type were top 3 features that influence the price of a car. Moreover, automated manual and manual transmission types were significant when automatic was the reference. |
| [üêù Bee Body Measurements on Dry Weight](https://github.com/lescer3/Impact-of-Body-Measurements-on-Dry-Weight) | Aug 2024 | ggplot2 | This is a research project I did over the summer that focuses on the impact of body measurements on dry weight. This was done to find a replacement to measuring head width and intertegular distance because specimen tend to have missing parts when preserved.|
| [üíé Diamond Prices](https://github.com/lescer3/Diamond-Prices) | June 2024 | car  | I, alongside my colleague, examined the relationship between several factors and its effect on the diamond price. |
