| [🚙 MSRP Project](https://github.com/lescer3/MSRP-Project) | Dec 2024 | dplyr, naniar, tidyr, ggplot2 | I built a machine learning model to predict the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of cars based on various features. In addition, I was interested in knowing the most important car features that influence the price of a car and if there was any significant price differences between the type of transmission. To sastify my curiosity, I compared Stepwise Regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forest, and PCA by RMSE. Random Forest performed the best with the lowest RMSE. Additionally, the year the car was released, engine horsepower, and engine fuel type were top 3 features that influence the price of a car. Moreover, automated manual and manual transmission types were significant when automatic was the reference. |
| [💎 Diamond Prices](https://github.com/lescer3/Diamond-Prices) | June 2024 | car  | I, alongside my colleague, examined the relationship between several factors and its effect on the diamond price. |
